# Logistic-Regression

This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression, a statistical method commonly used for binary classification tasks. The logistic regression model predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables.

# Key Features
## Mathematical Foundation: 
Derives predictions using the logistic/sigmoid function:

## Gradient Descent Optimization: 
Optimizes the coefficients (Œ≤) using the gradient descent algorithm to minimize the log-loss error function.

## Binary Classification: 
Ideal for problems with two classes (e.g., predicting Yes/No, Success/Failure).

# Code Overview
The implementation covers the following steps:

## Data Preprocessing:
Normalizes input features to ensure stable convergence during optimization.
Handles missing or categorical data as needed.

## Model Training:
Initializes parameters randomly or to zeros.
Iteratively updates weights using the gradient of the cost function:

where Œ± is the learning rate and ùêΩ(Œ≤) is the cost function. 

## Prediction:
Computes probabilities for each class using the sigmoid function.
Applies a threshold (default: 0.5) to classify observations.

## Evaluation:
Measures model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
To run this implementation, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.x

NumPy (for numerical computations)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
